# Summary
1. Prometheus java client (AKA simple client) does not provide functionality with annotations
2. Prometheus simple_spring_web have almost nothing in it!
3. Prometheus simple_spring_boot does not work for spring boot 2+ and they don't have plans to work on in in the future.
4. You can use Prometheus with micrometer, but you might lose a bit of functionality [Prometheus and Spring Boot 2+](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/issues/452).
